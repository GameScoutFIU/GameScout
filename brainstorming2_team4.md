## ðŸŽ‰ The winners of this [app ideas poll](https://github.com/elvisblanco1993/ios-group4-project/discussions/1) are:

### App Idea 1: Gametime App

- User Need: This app allows you to see all different types of gaming titles out whether it's on PC, Ps5, XBOX, Switch, etc. making it        easier for you to keep up with what's coming out or potentially find something new to play using the app.
- Market Research: The app is for people trying to find a new game to play. Somewhat like a Flixster app, except designed for video games     with categories pertaining to that.
- Feasibility: The idea can be accomplished from the skills learned within the Flixster pt 1 and 2 projects and the BeReal projects for       signing in and displaying videogames.
- Time Frame: 2 weeks
- Technical Constraints: Having a user-friendly interface for the frontend, access to the cloud for sign-in features, and backend for api-    calls
- Scalability: The video game industry is one of the biggest, making billions a year and with new innovations and games coming out all the    time. This app capitalizes on that by showing games that have come out and can be filtered through different categories. This app can       continue to grow as long as the video game industry continues to grow which shows no signs of stopping.


### App Idea 2: Trip Planner App

- User Need: Allows users to select premade travel plans with MapKit integration or make their own plan by choosing from a list of things to do.
- Market Research: While there is a few travel apps in the market, providing users an easy and straightfoward trip planner will bring in users who find other planners to complex.
- Feasability: This app can be accomplished given the knowledge of using databases to store userdata and create login functionality and MapKit functionality learned during the semester.
- Time Frame: An app with all these core features can be completed within a 2-4 week time frame.
- Technical Constraints: DB to store user plans saved and created plans by us, Login Functionality, and a clear and concise Front-End.
- Scalability: Future app could contain thousands of trip destinations and even event bookings and travel bookings such as hotels and flights.
