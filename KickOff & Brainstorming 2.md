# App Ideas

### Simple Budget Tracker:

- User Need: Helps users in budget management by tracking expenses and income.
- Market Research: While there are many budgeting apps, focusing on simplicity and ease of use could attract users who find existing apps too complex.
- Feasibility: Given the introductory nature of your course, creating a simple interface for inputting, storing, and visualizing data should be feasible.
- Time Frame: A basic version can be accomplished within a two-week frame with a focus on core features.
- Technical Constraints: Mainly involves frontend development and basic backend for data storage.
- Scalability: Future features could include linking bank accounts, expense categorization, and sharing budget reports.




### AI Homework Assistant: 

- User Need: Uses AI API to help students who are having issues within a topic.
- Research: Though there are many new tools for learning releasing since the publication of tools like gpt many     still do not help cover the topics specified with great depth or ease, many still do not understand how to utilize AI tools to assist with learning as well. 
- Feasibility: A tools like this would require a basic sign in page, cloud storage for the user sign in information, API calling mechanisms, a area in which a user is to type and chat with AI.
- Time Frame: 2 - 4 weeks to create a basic implementation of this application.
- Technical Constraints: Implementing the backend for the API calls, cloud storage for user data and frontend development for UI.
- Scalability: Future features could include inputting speicified user information such as topic, books, learning methods, current expertise in topic, etc.


### Gametime App:

- User Need: This app allows you to see all different types of gaming titles out whether it's on PC, Ps5, XBOX, Switch, etc. making it        easier for you to keep up with what's coming out or potentially find something new to play using the app.
- Market Research: The app is for people trying to find a new game to play. Somewhat like a Flixster app, except designed for video games     with categories pertaining to that.
- Feasibility: The idea can be accomplished from the skills learned within the Flixster pt 1 and 2 projects and the BeReal projects for       signing in and displaying videogames.
- Time Frame: 2 weeks
- Technical Constraints: Having a user-friendly interface for the frontend, access to the cloud for sign-in features, and backend for api-    calls
- Scalability: The video game industry is one of the biggest, making billions a year and with new innovations and games coming out all the    time. This app capitalizes on that by showing games that have come out and can be filtered through different categories. This app can       continue to grow as long as the video game industry continues to grow which shows no signs of stopping.

### AI Job App:


- User Need: Users will get personalized job recommendations, resume optimization, application tracking, and interview preparation tips with mock up questions and answers. 

- Market Research: Analyze the job search app market to identify competitors and gaps in the market. Study successful apps like LinkedIn, Indeed, and Glassdoor to understand their features and business models.
Research AI technologies such as natural language processing (NLP) for resume analysis, recommendation algorithms, sentiment analysis, and chatbots for user interaction.
Data Sources: Identify sources of job listings, including partnerships with companies, web scraping, and integration with job posting platforms like LinkedIn or Indeed.

- Feasibility: Assess the availability of job listings and candidate data for your app. Ensure you can collect, update, and maintain this data.
Evaluate the feasibility of implementing AI algorithms and models for tasks like matching job seekers with job listings and providing intelligent recommendations.
Legal and Ethical Considerations: Determine compliance with data privacy regulations like GDPR, and ensure ethical use of AI in the job search process.

-  Time Frame: 4 - 6 weeks to create a basic implementation of this application. 

-  Technical Constraints: Decide whether your app will be web-based, mobile, or both. Consider the technology stack, frameworks, and tools for development.

Implement robust security measures to protect user data and privacy.

-  Scalability: Consider using cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and flexibility.
Implement load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple servers to ensure the app can handle increased usage.
